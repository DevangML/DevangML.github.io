I am an engineering student at Vishwakarma Institute Of Technology, Pune.
I study in the AI-DS branch.
I love Machine Learning, artificial intelligence and web development.
I am a Linux enthusiast and like to keep Fedora as my main machine.
I am a security and privacy enthusiast too.
Over the last one year I have gained some hand over C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with two projects one in C and other in Python.
